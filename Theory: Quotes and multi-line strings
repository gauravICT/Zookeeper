You are already familiar with strings that are extremely common and useful in programming. Let's take a look at some features of Python strings related to quotes and multi-line strings.

1. Quotes
As you know, a string literal is surrounded by a pair of single or double quotes. There is basically no difference between the two, but there are some common conventions concerning the use:

use double quotes if your string contains single quotes, for example, "You're doing great!"
use single quotes if your string contains double quotes, for example, 'Have you read "Hamlet"?'
do NOT mix two styles in one literal, for example, something like "string!' is NOT correct
most importantly, be consistent in your use!
There is a way to include any quotes in your string, regardless of the style of the outer quotes, and that is to use the backslash symbol (\) before the quotes inside of the string. The backslash will basically tell Python that the quote symbol that follows it is a part of the string rather than its end or beginning. It is called escaping, and you'll learn about it in detail in the next topics. 

So in the examples below both ways of writing the strings are correct and will produce the same result:

# example 1
print("You're doing great!")
print('You\'re doing great!')
# example 2
print("Have you read \"Hamlet\"?")
print('Have you read "Hamlet"?')
Multiline strings
Strings can represent a long text, a single character or even zero characters (like an empty string). But so far our strings were just in one line, no matter how long they were. You can also write multi-line strings in Python, and to do that you need to use triple quotes on each side of the string literal. Again, which quotes to choose, single or double, is up to you, both work fine in Python.

2. Multi-line string in double quotes:
print("""This
is
a
multi-line
string""")
Multi-line string in single quotes:
print('''This
is
a
multi-line
string''')
Both examples print the same result:

This
is
a
multi-line
string
Well, these are just some basics, strings in Python are much more interesting, and there are so many things you can do with them!
