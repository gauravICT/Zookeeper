Every data object (a variable or a constant) has a type that describes how to keep it in memory, which operation can be applied to this object and how to compute them.

A real-world analogy of types may be biological species or any other abstract attribute shared among specific objects. All the dogs you've seen have type dog, but each of them is an individual object. Thinking about a dog as a type you can assume some operations available, for example, a dog can bark.

In this topic, we will consider only a few simplest data types that are commonly used in programming practice.

1. Strings
Whenever you want to work with some kind of textual information in your program, you'll have to work with strings. The string type is called str. Strings are extremely common and useful in Python. String literals may be delimited using either single or double quotes.

Examples of strings in double quotes:
print("")               # empty string
print("string")         # one word
print("Hello, world!")  # a sentence
Examples of strings in single quotes:
print('a')                   # single character
print('1234')                # a sequence of digits
print('Bonjour, le monde!')  # a sentence
In a real program, a string can represent an email of a person or an organization.

print('hello@hyperskill.org')  # printing an email
As you can see, strings are very easy to use!

2. Numerical types
Numbers are the most important thing for any programmer. There is hardly any serious program you can write without using numbers, so let's discuss some basic numerical types:

int (signed integers). Called integers or ints, they are whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero), having no decimal point;
float (floating-point numbers). Called floats, they represent real numbers and have a decimal point.
You can start working with a number by just printing it out.

print(11)    # prints 11
print(11.0)  # prints 11.0
Even though 11 and 11.0 are the same number, the former is an integer, and the latter is a float. The simplest way to distinguish them is that floats have a decimal point and integers don't. Be attentive!

You can also use negative numbers as well as zeroes:

print(0)      # prints 0
print(-5)     # prints -5
print(-1.03)  # prints -1.03
Integer numbers can be used to count things in the real world while floating-point numbers are a good choice for statistical and scientific calculations.

3. Printing types
We also have a way to clearly demonstrate types of different objects using the type() function which is a part of Python.

print(type('hello'))  # <class 'str'>
print(type("world"))  # <class 'str'>
 
print(type(100))      # <class 'int'>
print(type(-50))      # <class 'int'>
 
print(type(3.14))     # <class 'float'>
print(type(-0.5))     # <class 'float'>
As you can see from the examples above, the type() function indicates the data type of a passed value after the word class.
