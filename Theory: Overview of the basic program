1. The Hello World program
Our first example will be Hello, World! It is traditionally used to introduce beginners to a new programming language.

print("Hello, World!")
As you can see, it consists of a single line and just prints a string passed in the parentheses, but without quotes.

You should get this result:

Hello, World!

2. Short explanation
Here, print is the name of a function. A function is a block of code that does some useful work for you, e.g. prints a text. In some sense, a function is a subprogram that can be reused within your programs. When the name of a function is followed by parentheses, it means that it was called to get the result.

Let's go further, "Hello, World!" is a Python string. All strings are surrounded by either single or double quotes, so 'Hello, World!' is also a valid string. You may replace this string with another one, and the program will print the new string. For example:

print('Python 3.x')
As you might guess, this program will print:

Python 3.x

3. Printing quotes
If you would like to include quotes into a string, then enclose this string in quotes of another type, e.g.:

print("Yes, I'm ready to learn Python.")
It prints:

Yes, I'm ready to learn Python.

4. Possible errors
Even this simple line of code may contain errors, most common of them are:

putting extra indentation
   print("Hello, World!")
This does not work because of extra spaces before print.

calling the function by the wrong name
pint("Hello, World!")
This line contains pint instead of print. Make sure to refer to every function by its proper name.

writing names in the wrong case
PRINT("All caps")
Again, Print, print and PRINT are not the same. Names are case-sensitive in Python.

missing one or both quotes for a string
print("Python)
This does not work because of missing closing quotes.

missing one or more parentheses
print("I have no end"
Be careful with parentheses, especially when calling a function.
