# Zookeeper

Description :- 

There are many animals in the zoo: all of them need care, and some of them are endangered and require preservation efforts. Animals must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin and kept happy. That it a difficult task for such a big open-range zoo, so one of employers suggested a more convenient way to accomplish that. He wants to be able to watch any animal on the screen with the help of a special program. It will sure help her take care of our furry friends more efficiently!

In this project, we will create a program that helps the zookeeper check on the animals and see that they're well. This product will be able to understand commands from the zoo staff and show the animals on a monitor.
