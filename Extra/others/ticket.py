# Code Challenge â€” Write a program
# Lucky tickets are a kind of mathematical entertainment. A ticket is considered lucky if the sum of the first 3 digits coincides with the sum of the last 3 digits of the ticket number.
# You are supposed to write a program that checks whether the two sums are equal. The code snippet below displays "Lucky" if they do and "Ordinary" otherwise.

# However, some parts of the code are missing. Fill in the blanks to make it work!

# Input: a string of 6 digits.

# Output: either "Lucky" or "Ordinary" (without quotes).


# Save the input in this variable
ticket = input()

# Add up the digits for each half
half1 = int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1]) + int(ticket[2])
half2 = int(ticket[3]) + int(ticket[4]) + int(ticket[5])

# Thanks to you, this code will work
if half1 == half2:
    print("Lucky")
else:
    print("Ordinary")
