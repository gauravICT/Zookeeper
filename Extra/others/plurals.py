# Code Challenge â€” Write a program
# Alex wrote a program that reads a number and a word from the input to create phrases like "3 cats" and "1 dog". Unfortunately, the condition for plural nouns is currently missing. Alex doesn't know how to use if statements, but you do. Help Alex complete this program.
# The plural form of a word generally ends with s. All numbers, apart from 1, expect the plural form after them, even zero: "0 birds".
# Words that form their plural not by adding s, will NOT appear in the tests.
# Sample Input 1:
# 1
# engineer
# Sample Output 1:
# 1 engineer

# Sample Input 2:
# 12
# student
# Sample Output 2:
# 12 students

# code starts from here
number = int(input())
word = input()

# write a condition for plurals
if number != 1:
    print(number, word + 's')
if number == 1:
    print(number, word)
