You can use a programming language like Python as a calculator or work with constant values like strings. Is it enough for you, though? When writing real programs, you usually need to store values or evaluation results in computer memory.

1. What is a variable?
Variable is a named place where you can store some value and access the value later. Imagine a box where you keep something. That's a variable.

For example, you calculate something and would like to reuse the formula for some other numbers. In this case, you operate only these "boxes".

In general, it's a good practice to give a variable a name that describes its content.

2. Defining a variable and assigning values
You can keep almost anything in variables just assigning the new value for a named variable with an equal sign.

day_of_week = "Monday"
Now you have a string typed value "Monday" stored in computer memory. You can retrieve the value by calling the variable name.

print(day_of_week)  # Monday
Now, day_of_week stores a value of the str type.

print(type(day_of_week))  # <class 'str'>
You can always assign a new value to a defined variable:

day_of_week = "Tuesday"
Now, you will retrieve another value:

print(day_of_week)  # Tuesday
It is possible to assign the value of one variable to another variable:

a = 10
b = a  # b is 10
If you haven't defined a variable within the scope of your code, you'll see an error:

print(month_name)  # NameError: name 'month_name' is not defined
Python allows you to assign values of different types to the same variable. Let's assign the string name of a month to a variable and print its type.

month = "December"
print(type(month))  # <class 'str'>
Now, let's assign the number of this month to the variable and print its type again.

month = 12
print(type(month))  # <class 'int'>
This works because Python is a language with dynamic typing.

Please, do not overuse it! If your code is quite long, you might forget that you have changed the type. And this is the breeding ground for errors!

3. Naming rules
As we mentioned above,  each variable has a specific name that distinguishes it from other variables. There are some rules for naming variables that you should follow:

names are case-sensitive (month is not the same as Month);
a name begins with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, digits, and underscores (e.g. user_name, score1, _count);
name cannot start with a digit (e.g. 2q is not a valid name);
a name must not be a keyword.
