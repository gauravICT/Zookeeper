Let's consider an example, the following code prints exactly three strings, each from a new line:

print("I")
print("know")
print("Python")
The output is:

I
know
Python
You can run this example here or locally if you have already installed Python on your computer.

There are other ways to print the same text using just one function call. We will consider them in the next topics.

The print function also allows you to print an empty line with no string specified:

print("I")
print()
print("know")
print()
print("Python")
Here's the output:

I
 
know
 
Python
